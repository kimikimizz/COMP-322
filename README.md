# COMP 322
This repository stores my assignments for COMP 322 (Introduction to C++) at McGill. 

## About the assignments
Assignment 1: In this assignment we will be imitating the inner workings of the operating system by managing a piece of memory 
of a fixed size and then enabling clients to use this memory without collision between users. 
We will be building a Data Store manager to help us get access to chunks of memory that we can use to store integers.

Assignment 2: Rebuilding A1 using OOP, custom Linked List, and pointers.

Assignment 3: Building BlackJack game using OOP (in progress)
