# COMP 322
This repository stores my assignments for COMP 322 (Introduction to C++) at McGill. 

## About the assignments
Assignment 1: In this assignment we will be imitating the inner workings of the operating system by managing a piece of memory 
of a fixed size and then enabling clients to use this memory without collision between users. 
We will be building a Data Store manager to help us get access to chunks of memory that we can use to store integers.

Assignment 2: Rebuilding A1 using OOP, custom Linked List, and pointers.

Assignment 3: Building BlackJack game using OOP (in progress)

## About Plagirism
All codes have been uploaded after the due date of the assignments, and reflect my personal effort. <br />
Don't copy!!! You never know, maybe I didn't even receive a passing grade. <br />
For COMP 322, no starter code was provided for any of the assignments, except for the main() method. All lines are 100% my own work. <br />
Although assignments change each semester, please do let me know if any of these are reused after Winter 2022.
